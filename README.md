# Strava HR Aggregator
The Strava HR Aggregator tabulates time spent at heart rate across multiple activities. It was developed to simplify the process of tracking time spent at heart rate for those of us that train off a heart rate monitor

Because of strava call limits, I'm only using this to append the last 1-2 weeks of training to a separate log at this time

## Usage
You can [Get Started with the Strava API here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/)
This is built with [Strava Lib which can be found here](https://stravalib.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1/index.html)

## Roadmap
Future versions
-improve token generation process
-functionality to export results to a separate file
-graphing/plotting of trends
-integrated "database" to connect directly to a larger global workout log
